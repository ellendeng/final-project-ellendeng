Do you feel overwhelmed when you order a bottle of wine at the restaurant or buy from supermarket or wine store?
Wine selection is complicated and personal. The one you love doesnâ€™t necessarily depend on the rating or price. It depends on your personal taste. And only high-end restaurants have sommeliers who can help you on wine selection.

This application can recommend the best wine at my favorite restaurant - Bottega Louie based on my taste and food pairing.

Input:
- wine list in jpg form from bottega louie. Please use the jpg file in the repository
- wine information including style, food pairing and user rating: wine-search.com

Output:
- the best wine recommendation based on food pairing

Introduction

Do you feel overwhelmed when you order a bottle of wine at the restaurant or buy from supermarket or wine store?
Wine selection is complicated and personal. The one you love doesnâ€™t necessarily depend on the rating or price. It depends on your personal taste. And only high-end restaurants have sommeliers who can help you on wine selection.

This application can recommend the best wine at my favorite restaurant - Bottega Louie based on my taste and food pairing.
